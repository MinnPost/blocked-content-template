# Blocked Content Template
This plugin adds type-blocked-postname, type-blocked-post, type-blocked to the beginning of the single template hierarchy, and then attempts to locate them in the theme.

If no blocked templates exist, it will contine to check the default hierarchy for a matching file, and load that one.
